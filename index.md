# Required softwares
---

* Python 3
* Flask Library
* Jinja2 Template Engine
* Arduino IDE
* PyCharm IDE
* RealTerm Serial/TCP Terminal Emulator
* MATLAB

<br/>

## Installation instructions
---

The instructions are given assuming you’re all Windows OS users, if you need an instruction for Ubuntu / Linux distros as well; please let the instructors know.

> *[Disclaimer: If you’re a Python 2 user and reluctant to change it, I’d suggest you to modify the codes corresponding to your python version]*

<br/>

# 1. Python 3
---

Download Python 3 [from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/){:target="_blank"} and install using administrative privilege. Make sure you’ve ticked the option where it says that it will add python to the environment variable.

#### How to check if python is added to the path or not:

Open a command window, and enter the following command

```python
python --version
```

If something like this shows up, then you’ve successfully configured python.

```
Python 3.X.X
```

> Nota Bene: The major version should be `3`, minor version doesn't matter.

#### Troubleshooting

If python version doesn’t appear at the console then **check if python has been added to the PATH variable or not.** 
There are a lot of ways to solve the problem. One way is by just googling.


<br/>


# 2. Flask library
---

Flask is a simple Python based micro-framework for developing web applications. [If you don’t understand what I’m saying, don’t need to worry, I’ll clear everything before diving deeper] 

Open a command window with administrative privilege [or open a command window as admin (Run As Admin)]

Enter the following command

```
pip3 install flask
```

This will automatically download and install flask.

<br/>

# 3. Jinja2 Templating Framework
---

Enter the following command (yes in a command window with administrative privilege)

```
pip3 install jinja2
```

<br/>


# 4. Arduino IDE
---

Collect the latest Arduino IDE and install it on your computer [from here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software){:target="_blank"}.

#### Make sure:


> Your Arduino Device is working with the IDE properly.


<br/>

# 5. PyCharm Python IDE
---

Download and install the [PyCharm IDE from here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/download/#section=windows-version){:target="_blank"}. 

<br/>

# 6. RealTerm Serial Terminal Emulator
---
Download and install RealTerm, [from here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/){:target="_blank"}.

<br/>

# What you *MUST* bring at the workshop!
---

* A laptop with **WORKING WIFI DEVICE, LAPTOP CHARGER** and a **MULTIPLUG**
* If possible bring a **MODEM** too
* Personal **Arduino**
* Any components you'd like to share

<br/>
